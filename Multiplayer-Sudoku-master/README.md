### Project layout

Using `gradle` we can better allow collaboration between all OS's without the
need to tie us down to a specific IDE. (We could use maven or ant, but I hate
them ðŸ˜¥)

##### Gradle IDE support

 - [Gradle support for Eclipse.](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html)
 - [Gradle support for intellJ.](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-gradle.html)
 - [Gradle support for netbeans.](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/44510/gradle-support)

### Code style

[This is the bracket/indentation style I like the most, open to suggestions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_1TBS_(OTBS))
